## HTML Structure
The project follows a structured HTML layout to ensure semantic markup and better accessibility. It includes the main sections and components found on the Airbnb website. 

## CSS Styling
The CSS files are responsible for styling the HTML elements to replicate the visual design of the Airbnb website. The goal is to match the colors, fonts, layouts, and other styling aspects.
